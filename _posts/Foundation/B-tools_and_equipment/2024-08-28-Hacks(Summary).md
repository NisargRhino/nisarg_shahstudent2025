Version Control

While creating my typewriter effect on my homepage, I went through several iterations of my code in order to test out different features, and customize the visualization to make it more minimalistic. I used version control to track how the changes I made were reflected on to my homepage. 

I have my respitory cloned on my desktop where I can also access my files, however, I typically use WSL when making changes to my site. 

The files in my github are updated when I push my changes from VSCode and sync my changes to the repository. 

I would use CSS and Javascript to customize the default to UI of the 'portfolio_2025' to include more features and make the design unique. I would also add a capture page to document screenshots of important teaching moments. 

Localhost vs Deployed Server(Nisarg)

When cloning my repository in VSCode, I deployed a local host URL by running the command "make" on my VSCode terminal. This is a local site to only your computer meaning no one else can see those updates.

When commiting and pushing to update your github repository, those changes are updated to your github pages website. Since this is on a github domain and is public, others can see the updates that you put onto the site. 


DNS and Github Pages

There is a domain for my Github pages, my website is hosted on github.io.

The URL for each Github Page is different. The website follows the syntax of usernmae.github.io/respository_name
